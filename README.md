<h1>Android Malware Detection - RFC</h1>
This repository contains the code for the Machine Learning and Data Analysis course at the University of Genoa. The course is part of the
Master's degree in Computer Science.
<h3>Intro</h3>
During this project, we have used Random Forest Classification to create a model that will detect if an Android application is malware or not.

<h3><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dannyrevaldo/android-malware-detection-dataset/data">Dataset</a></h3>
The dataset consists of 328 columns, including 326 binary features, which are possible Android application permissions, and another one which is label, if the application is malware or benign.
<h3><a href="https://github.com/parsamlm/Android-Malware-RFC/blob/main/Machine%20Learning%20Presentation.pdf">Presentation File</a></h3>
To showcase our Android Random Forest classification project, we have utilized this file. The project's primary objective is to accurately classify Android applications as either benign or malicious.
